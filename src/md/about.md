## About Our Editorial Process

- **Description of the Physical Document**

    Description of the physical document may include an indication of letterhead, the image on a postcard, and enclosures. This description also includes the address on a postcard or envelope, the postmark, and any additional notation on the envelope, whether written by Beckett or in another hand (e.g. forwarding address, postal directives). 
    
- **Postmarks**

    Postmarks are indicated by city (not by post office) and date.
    
- **Notations of Bibliographical Description**

    Notations of bibliographical description indicate whether the letter is handwritten or typed; whether a plain card, card imprinted with Beckett’s name, letter, picture postcard, lettercard, telegram, pneumatique; the description indicates the number of leaves and sides, and whether the letter is signed, initialed, or unsigned. (See abbreviations)

    Dates are presented as written by Beckett, who most often follows European format (day, month, year),  If the date, or any portion of it, is incomplete or incorrect, editorial emendation is given in square brackets; if a date, or any portion of it, is uncertain, this emendation is preceded by a question mark.

When a letter is written on letterhead, the letterhead is indicated.

- **Addresses**

    Addresses are presented as written, and regularized to facilitate searches.
