# About the Project

*The Letters of Samuel Beckett* archive houses the transcriptions and translations of every known letter penned by the Irish writer Samuel Beckett. Representing more than thirty years of work, the task of gathering these letters entailed accessing archives and private collections scattered across the globe. With the publication of the final printed volume of *The Letters of Samuel Beckett* in 2016, the question arose of what to do with the archive, especially since it is not open to the public and because the rights to the content of many of the letters are held by other institutions. *The Letters of Samuel Beckett* database project was born out of a desire to make the metadata and content of these letters accessible to researchers and to the wider public, thereby preserving the cumulative knowledge and collective efforts that have gone into creating the original analogue archive.

By utilizing this database, visitors are able to view the name of each letter’s recipient, the location from which and to which each letter was sent, and the name of the archive or private collection that currently holds the letter. In addition, key entities—person, place, organization, production, directing, publication, translating, and writing—have been tagged within the text of each letter, thus allowing researchers to gain limited access to this content. Visitors to the database site can also read biographies of letter recipients and learn about both the unique challenges and interesting anecdotes that the project has generated.
